# Why I start this project?
Nowadays, there are many React Native starter projects, seed projects and template projects are published on GitHub.
All those projects has its own advantages and disadvantages.
While I am investigating other senior developers starter kits, I finally summarized all those efforts and made my own source structure depends on many years of my Javascript and React Native experiences.
I think this project should be very helpful for everybody who loves React Native.
